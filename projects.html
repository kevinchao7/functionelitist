									<h2>EBOV Project</h4>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="resources/FE_Gallery/ebov1.jpg" alt="" /></span> For the longest time, turbocharged engines in the production and racing worlds have had pressure-surge discharge valves, known as blow-off valves (BOV), operated mechanically by vacuum lines.  When the engine goes into hard deceleration, also known as engine-braking, and vacuum is created that pulls on the vacuum diaphragm of the BOV to release the surge of forced-induction created by the turbocharger.  With the advent of microcontrollers and higher processing power, what advantages can be seen when switching a vacuum-actuated BOV to an electronically actuated BOV? In comes the Electronic Blow-Off Valve (EBOV).  By using pressure sensor data (Boost), engine speed data (RPM), throttle position data (TPS), and lateral acceleration data (G-Force), and EBOV can show improvements in the racing world by making a more responsive vehicle that is able to put power to the ground more quickly or by making a safer production vehicle for the public to use.  In addition to reacting to pressure surges in the induction system and reducing them, the following improvements were discovered and proven:  A more responsive race engine,  better handling for racers, and reduced driver error (such as spinning out of control).

										Similar to a lot of current CAD/CAM software available, this program specifically writes CNC programs for Electron and Laser Beam CNC Welding machines. Almost no CNC experience or knowledge is needed, because the user interface and terminology are more in “Layman’s Terms”. As long as one understands the fundamentals of welding, anyone should be able to write a CNC weld programs in just a few clicks. Many of the paths, indexing motions, and equations common to Linear, Plug, or Tube welds are written in the software. Simply type in the weld parameters to achieve target penetration (such as beam power, table speed, focus, slope in or out, pattern generation/rastering, etc) and choose whether the weld is a straight pass, a round path, or a tubular path.  Conflict-Logic has been included in the software, so if an operator calls for two conflicting parameters or for a variable outside the machine's limitations, the software will write the CNC program using the more common method or limiting values. In addition to automatically resolving conflicts, the user will be warned that a correction had occurred. Version 1.0 is limited to the most common types of welds. An upcoming version will include flat and tube slots, flat and tube plates, and sine-wave welds over plates or tubes.

										Destructive and Non-Destructive Testing. Radiographic scanning allows us to find porosity or cracking inside the weld without destroying the component. Some specifications, such as AMS2681, allow for a one-time reweld attempt to remove any defects in the weld, potentially saving the component from being written off as noncompliant.

										I created a Precision Welding Presentation to teach upcoming engineers some concepts about high energy density weld processes, what to keep in mind when designing weld configurations, and how to be a designer of cost-effective components. I frequently return to Cal Poly Pomona to keep in contact with my professors and set up future dates for a workshop/presentation.
